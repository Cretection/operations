Github Issue Tracker
--------------------

Create an issue here `operations on github <https://github.com/kanow/operations/issues>`__ if you have problems.
Normally this is for bugs but sometimes it's unclear what it is ;-).

Slack
-----

The fastest way to get support is the dedicated channel on slack to get in touch with other users and/or me.

The url is: https://typo3.slack.com/messages/ext-operations/

If you have already Slack installed, looking for the Slack Channel `ext-operations`.
