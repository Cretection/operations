The extension were written to manage firefighter operations in TYPO3 pages. The data for operations can be provided in TYPO3 Backend by editors. Many detailed information e.g. used vehicles, recources, assistance and more are possible. This extension can be used for other institutions like THW, police or security agencys too.




.. note::

  Features in the frontend:

    - List/single view of reports
    - filter list by type and year
    - Show location on a map in single view
    - Map with all locations instead of normal list view
    - Statistics by operation type with a bar chart (made with http://chartjs.org)


.. important::

   From this version only TYPO3 9.5 is supported.
