What does it do?
================


The extension was written to manage firefighter operations with information of used vehicles, recources and other things they are needed for full reports. Of course this extension can be used for other institutions like THW, police, security agencys or other reportable events.

Since version 1.0.6 a google map view for the operation locations was added. In single view a little map is automatically shown and for the list of all operations on a bigger map you have to activate a checkbox in the plugin.

At the moment it's only possible to filter the list by year. For future is planned to filter by operation type and a full text search in reports. Furthermore i'm going to integrate an archive view.

The only thing i need to do all these fine things is a little bit more time ;-).



**Support**

I hope you have fun with this extension.
