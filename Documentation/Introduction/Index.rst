What does it do?
================


The extension were written to manage firefighter operations with information of used vehicles, recources and other things they are needed for full reports. Of course this extension can be used for other institutions like THW, police, security agencys or other reportable events.

At the moment it's only possible to filter the list by year. For future is planned to filter by operation type and add a full text search in reports. Furthermore i'm going to build a map view (coordinates and zoom can be filled by now) and an archive view.

The only thing i need to do all these fine things is a little bit more time ;-).
