============

:ref:`Install <install>` the extension and create 3 pages for 

- list and single view for operations (one page)
- single view for vehicles (one page)
- single view for resources (one page)

After this create sysfolder for data sets of vehicles, resources, assistance, type and operation itself.
Set the pids of pages for vehicle, resource and operation view in typoscript constants.
Look at the settings in plugin flexform fields or use typoscript constants to fit the settings.

Now you can add your data for types, vehicles, resources and assistance to use this relations in operation reports.


If i forget anything (i hope i did not ;-)) feel free to write an e-mail or open an issue on `forge`.
