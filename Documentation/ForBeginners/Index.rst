For Beginners
=============

If you are not familiar with TYPO3 and/or using and installing extensions, this chapter is for you!
I will guide you step by step trough the installation and configuration of the extension `operations`.
I assume you have already installed your TYPO3 and you are logged in in Backend?

If yes, we can start.
